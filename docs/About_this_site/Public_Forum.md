## Open for Public Discussion!

We've chosen to set up this site in order to provide space for public discusion at the bottom of each page. This is something of an experiment. We reserve the right to take away the discussion part at any time, particularly if things get out of hand. But we are optimistic that we will get useful engagement, suggestions, and help from the arXiv community.
