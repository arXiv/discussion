## Open for Public Discussion!

We've chosen set up this site so there's space for public discusion at the bottom of each page. This is something of an experiment. We reserve the right to take away the discussion part at any time, particularly if things get out of hand. But we're optimistic that we'll get useful engagement, suggestions, and help from the arXiv community.
