"BC" is "Before Cloud". This section is a description of arXiv as it existed circa 2022, which is before most services started being migratated to the cloud. This represents a snapshot in time that's described here mostly as a comparison point &ndash; which can be used as reference point for the changes we're making and plan to make.
