# Introduction

CE stands for Cloud Edition.

This is the public documentation site for the project to move arXiv to the cloud. We will use this place to share our plans with the arXiv community, and also seek feedback and suggestions from the community. We will try to keep this site up to date as our plans become implementations and as our implementations are put into production.

We're inviting community participation in this effort. See [Open For public Discussion](About_this_site/Public_Forum)
